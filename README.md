Description
This project is a simple script written in JavaScript that calculates the final velocity, distance, and remaining fuel of a moving object after a certain time period. It considers initial parameters such as velocity, acceleration, time, fuel, and fuel burning rate.

Features
- Calculates final velocity based on initial velocity, acceleration, and time.
- Calculates final distance based on initial velocity and time.
- Calculates remaining fuel based on initial fuel amount and fuel burn rate.

Learning Outcomes
* Understanding of basic physics concepts such as velocity, acceleration, and distance.
* Application of mathematical formulas to solve real-world problems.
